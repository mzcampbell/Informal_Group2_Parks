The parking is in a gravel lot just before the turn-around on the right side of the road in front of the 19th century resettlement structures. When you get out of the car, the visitor center will be to your left up a small incline accessed via a red asphalt trail. The small visitor center features a bookstore, several interpretive panels and a model of how the church may once have looked. To access the restrooms, continue past the visitor center and turn right on the paved trail shortly before crossing the road.\",\n",

The approach to the building itself is a wide brick walkway with a slight incline. It turns to the right as you near the building; here there are three flag poles displaying, from left to right, the Louisiana state flag, the United States flag and the flag of Acadiana. On either side are green plants, trees and grasses. In season, there are lavender azaleas. As you enter through the front door, you are in a large, high-ceilinged room with several square pillars spaced throughout. From that position, there are the following points of interest: Ten feet ahead is the information desk, staffed by a park ranger. To the right, 25 feet away is the counter for the book store. The book store has tables and shelves with a variety of products including books and toys. To your left, roughly 60 feet away, is the museum. The museum exhibits are related to Cajun culture, displaying clothing, musical instruments, among other items. At the 1:00 position is the entrance to the theater, 30 feet away. The theater has 175 seats with a movie screen at the front of the room. At roughly the 10:00 position, you\\u2019ll find the bathroom vestibule, 45 feet away. There is one, single-occupancy bathroom available to visitors; once you enter the vestibule, turn left and walk along a wall to your left to the bathroom door ahead. (You will pass a closest door on your left before reaching the bathroom.) As you navigate your surroundings, keep in mind that there are pillars spaced at regular intervals around the space.\",\n",

The lot is tight, however, and many people with motor homes choose to park in the on-street spaces, which have a two hour limit. From the parking lot, the visitor will cross the Andrew Johnson Early Home yard. A brick sidewalk runs through the yard, and they may stop and read waysides or walk through the open first floor of the home, which contains exhibits pertaining to Johnson's early life. When the visitor reaches College Street, they will find a crosswalk with a sign advising on-coming traffic to stop for pedestrians, as it is mid-street and not at the designated corner cross-walk. Visitors may choose to cross at either location, but ensure that traffic has come to a stop before proceeding at both. The restrooms and water fountains will be on your right as you walk toward the main Visitor Center entrance. The double doors into the Visitor Center are manually automatic. A ranger or volunteer will be on hand to provide orientation to the park as soon as you enter the room.\",\n",

      "            \"audioDescription\": \"Arches National Park Visitor center is located just beyond the park entrance off of highway 191 North of Moab, UT. The building and parking lot sit at the base of towering sandstone walls formed by the Moab fault. Beyond the turn into the parking lot, the park road snakes up and above the visitor center, which leads to the rest of the park atop the plateau. Once past the entrance booths, a right turn after the roundabout leads to the parking lot and visitor center. The parking lot is spacious, with a small shade structure and picnic tables on its Northwest side. The visitor center building is located to the right-- northeast of the lot. The building itself is multi-storied and angular, painted different shades of beige, tan, and light maroon. In front of the building is an extensive interpretive plaza, shaded by two columns of ramada style roofing, one running along the Northwest side of the plaza, the other, along the Southeast. Each section is held up by several sandstone brick pillars. In the center of these two shaded sections sits a series of decorative boulders and bronze statues of wildlife. Restrooms and other amenities are located just beyond these statues along the northeast wall. The overall low profile of the building and shade structures gives the sense that the structure is part of the colorful sandstone layers located beyond and above it. Scanning the Interpretive plaza clockwise from the parking lot, several trash and recycling bins are visible near the leftmost brick pillar. The following pillar features two water filling stations, a spicket and informational panel on each side. The next pillar, which extends back towards the visitor center entrance in the northeast corner of the plaza, features a large NPS Arrowhead and the words \\u2018Arches National Park.\\u2019 The remaining two pillars curve towards the building entrance and feature large informational panels about wildlife and park features respectively. A section of windows with two double doors on the left marks the entrance to the visitor center building. Continuing to the right, the northeast wall of the plaza features a low bench, payphones, trashcan, and a shaded alcove with access to two gendered and one handicapped accessible family restroom. Opposite the first column of pillars, a second shade structure runs East to south. Underneath the structure, the pillars feature additional informational panels; \\u201cClimbing and Canyoneering,\\u201d \\u201cWhat to do at Arches,\\u201d \\u201cPark Features,\\u201d and a gold lettered quote that reads: \\u201cExtraordinary arches, awe-inspiring landscapes.\\u201d Closer to the parking lot, the last two pillars also feature low benches. A flagpole with a raised American Flag stands closest to the road on the sidewalk before the parking lot. In the center of the plaza are several large rocks and life-sized bronze statues of wildlife in Arches. The floor beneath these statues is characterized by a sweeping patch of rough, light gray cement, in contrast to the smooth orange cement of the rest of the plaza. A male bighorn sheep sits atop the largest rock, a small lizard and two ravens perch on a neighboring boulders. A female bighorn sheep and baby stand closest to the parking lot, another lizard on a smaller rock behind them. Past these statues, one enters to visitor center through the double doors in the northernmost corner of the visitor center plaza. The entryway leads to a large mural of delicate arch, flanked by two digital trip planning kiosks. Directly in front of this mural is a large three dimensional relief map of the park at about waist height. To the left of this map is the park store. Several kiosks and display shelves are present in the entry way of the store. To the right of the relief map is the visitor center information desk. Behind the desk are panels with photographs of different prominent rock features in the park. To the right, a small inlet against the large windows facing the plaza holds two televisions mounted to each wall, used for orientation and safety videos. To the left of the information desk is the exhibit hall, which leads to various exhibits on the geology, environment, wildlife, and history of the park. The exhibit hall features a large two story window that looks up towards the sandstone wall behind the visitor center, and several large scale models of arches and sandstone features weave throughout the exhibits. On the far end of the exhibit hall sits the entryway to the theater, which seats 114 persons for showings of the park film.\",\n",

The Assateague Island Visitor Center faces northwest and is a rectangular, one story gray building with white trim. A decorative flying bird sculpture is attached to the north side of the building. A slightly curved ramp gradually leads up to a covered deck. The covered deck connects the visitor center on its east side, to the restroom facilities on its west side. Under the covered deck is a large table map display of Assateague Island. Attached to the southside of the restroom facilities is a large outdoor bench that looks out over the Sinepuxent Bay. Rocking chairs and a binocular viewing station provide views to the south and east over the bay. The visitor center has a set of glass automated doors that may be used by pushing the button on the south side of the doors. Inside the visitor center there is a book store immediately on the north side of the building. As the building continues east there is an information desk, an auditorium and a touch tank exhibit on the north side wall. Along the east side of the building are two large aquariums and a horse skeleton exhibit. The south side of the visitor center has a large anchor on display, panels explaining island movement and windows looking out over the marsh.

Continuing straight ahead will take you to the front door of the visitor center which opens outward towards the porch. Once inside the door there is an information desk directly ahead about 5 feet. A ranger is usually at this desk for assistance. The interior of the visitor center is an open room with a fireplace at the center in the back. There is a bookstore entrance on the left side of the fireplace. Just left of the fireplace is another entrance/exit that steps out onto the sidewalk.

The first section of the ramp is about 30 ft., then turns right about 40 degrees. The next section is about 35 ft., then turns right again about 30 degrees. This section is 40 ft. to the wooden deck in front of the visitor center. The deck is level. The visitor center is 40 ft. ahead. Entry is through glass doors into a small foyer then about 6 ft. to a second set of glass doors. The ranger's desk is directly ahead about 8 ft. To the right is a museum, with exhibits of the geology, biology, natural history, and human history of the Barataria region. The museum has a wide entrance and is about 20 ft. from the ranger's desk. The exhibits are along the walls and in a large island in the middle of the museum holding more exhibits. A few of the exhibits are equipped with sound; most are not. Also in the visitor center is a theater. Entry to the theater is through a door that is immediately to the right of the entrance. The theater is entered by making a right U-turn after entering the visitor center. The restrooms are outside the visitor center in a separate building. Leave the visitor center through the glass doors and turn sharply right. The building with the restrooms is about 40 ft. away. The men's room is the nearest on the left side of the building, and the women's restroom is on the right. In between are a large drinking fountain and entrance to a handicapped/family restroom. Also between the visitor center and the building with the restrooms are two picnic tables, both closer to the visitor center than to the restroom.\",\n",

Some of the western part of the meadow serves as a fenced horse pasture. The Bear Valley Visitor Center was constructed to resemble a large barn and is painted gray. Inside the visitor center are a bookstore, an information desk, an auditorium, and museum exhibits. On the right just before one passes through the visitor center's front double doors is a hallway leading to the restrooms. As one enters the visitor center, the bookstore is immediately to one's left, the information desk ahead and to the left, the entrance to the auditorium immediately beyond the information desk, and the museum exhibits to the right. The museum exhibits contain taxidermied animals and exhibits about the park's major ecosystems, including coastal wetlands, coastal shorelines, coastal grasslands, forests, and open ocean. There are also exhibits about human history at Point Reyes.\",\n",

The main door swings out for entry and is reached by steps from the sidewalk. Just inside the main door you are in a long lobby with the Visitor Information Center to the right and public restrooms located to the left. A wheel chair accessible ramp and push button door opener (door swings out) allow entry to the building lobby from the off-street parking area on the right side of the building. There is a handicap parking area right beside this ramp. Public restrooms are located just off the lobby on the left of the main door -- to reach, turn left, walk to the end of the lobby, turn right and walk about 10 steps where you will pass through an open archway. Turn left, and step forward -- the men's restroom is straight ahead, and the women's is on the left. Handicap stalls and diaper changing locations are available in both facilities. The visitor information center is to the right of the main door -- walk to the end of the lobby, turn left and walk forward past the handicap accessible door and through a single wide door into the visitor information center. This is a single room with touchable exhibits and an information desk. This center is often a self-service facility, but if the ranger or volunteer is there you can ask for a recorded self-guided tour of the various exhibits inside the building.\",\n",

The one-story, tan, wood and steel visitor center has grey concrete set of parallel to a gently sloping concrete path, lead to the main entrance of the building. The building is surrounded on its west and south side by large parking lots accommodating dozens of vehicles. The building is bordered on its north and west by horizontally layered, jagged, badlands formations extending between 50 and 100 feet high. On the north side of the building, there are three picnic chairs with shade structures above them. Across the parking lot on the Visitor Center's eastern wall, there is a tan concrete welcome sign with the National Park Service logo and the text \\\"Welcome to the Ben Reifel Visitor Center.\\\" The main entrance is on the west side of the building, with a secondary entrance on the south side. On the southwest corner of the building, the text \\\"Ben Reifel Visitor Center\\\" is written in metal letters and affixed to the building. The main entrance leads to a lobby-area accommodating at most twelve people at a time. On one side is a curved information desk with a large map showing the locations of visitor services and animals within the park. On the other side is the park bookstore with a variety of souvenir and educational items for sale. At the northeast corner of the room there is a darkly light pathway that leads to exhibits about the park's resources. Beside that is the entrance to the theater. The southeast corner of the lobby leads to a hallway with three doors, in succession from north to south, they are the men's restroom, the women's restroom, and the entrance to the fossil preparation laboratory where visitors can observe and interact with paleontology technicians as they prepare fossils throughout the park. There is a hallway to the east that is marked for employees only, and to the south a pair of double doors leading outside the building. End of Description.\",\n",

The main campground road leads south from the entrance to a small parking area in front of a single-story rectangular building with a low peaked roof. The building is painted pale yellow and the roof has bright red shingles. There is a set of 6 stairs with a center handrail that lead up to the building\\u2019s entrance. The building may also be accessed without stairs by using a sidewalk on the west side. The entrance to the building is a single swinging door that opens out. The entrance door leads to a hallway. On the right side of the hallway is a counter where rangers greet visitors and provide information. On the left is a closed door that leads to a conference room and a large map mounted to the wall showing trails in the area. After the counter on the right is the entrance to a small gift shop that sells books and souvenirs. After the entrance to the gift shop on the right is a display window with information about the current exhibit. Past the display window and also on the right is a water fountain and bottle fill station. Across from the display window, on the left side of the entry way is a bench with 2 seats separated by a low table and another closed door that leads to the conference room. The entry way has an exit door opposite the entrance door which opens out to a sandy staff parking area. Passing straight through the gift shop is a small gallery. The walls and ceiling are made of wooden planks, art is displayed on white exhibit boards. There is a low bench with three seats in the center of the room. The gallery changes three times a year to feature work from the park\\u2019s artists in residence and local students. Continuing straight through the gallery along the right-hand wall is a low ramp with a handrail on the left side.
